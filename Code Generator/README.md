## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Code Generator Directory

Move into the `Code Generator` folder:

```bash
cd Code-Generator
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook

Launch the Jupyter notebook to start experimenting with code conversion:

```bash
jupyter notebook code_generator.ipynb
```

This will open an interactive notebook where you can input Python code and view the generated C++ code.

## Code Generation

In the **Code Generator** directory, you'll find the `code_generator.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook guides you through the conversion process from Python to C++, explaining each step involved.

The main sections of the notebook include:
- **Python Code Parsing**: How Python code is parsed and analyzed.
- **C++ Code Generation**: How the equivalent C++ code is generated based on the Python input.
- **Gradio Interface**: Interactive interface to convert Python code to C++ in real time.

Explore the notebook and test different Python code snippets to see how they are converted to C++.
