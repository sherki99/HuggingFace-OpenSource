## Optimizing and Using Instruction-Based Models for Text Generation

1. **Setup and Install Dependencies**:
   - Installed necessary libraries for working with models (e.g., `requests`, `torch`, `transformers`).

2. **Login to Hugging Face**:
   - Logged into Hugging Face using your API token to access models.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Chose instruction-based models from Hugging Face like **LLAMA**, **PHI3**, **GEMMA2**, **QWEN2**, **MIXTRAL** for generating text.

4. **Model Optimization**:
   - Used quantization (4-bit precision) to optimize models for lower memory usage without sacrificing too much accuracy.

5. **Tokenizer Setup**:
   - Set up a tokenizer for processing input text and converting it into a format understood by the model.

6. **Model Loading**:
   - Loaded the chosen model (**PHI3** in this case) with the optimized configuration.

7. **Text Generation**:
   - Generated text by feeding input messages to the model and printing the output.

8. **Memory Management**:
   - Checked the model's memory usage and cleared GPU cache to optimize performance.

9. **Experimentation with Different Models**:
   - Tried out other models like **GEMMA2** for generating text based on a new prompt.
